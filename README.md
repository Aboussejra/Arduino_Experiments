Learning to program the ESP32 microcontroller

The ESP32 has been programmed such as :

    After 20 seconds of inactivity, the microcontroller falls into deep sleep.

    Pushing the black button makes the device wake up and display the current menu option.

    Pushing again on the black button displays the next menu option.

    Turning the potentiometer changes the dim, or the color.

    Menu options are: 1. display temperature and humidity, 2. change temperature F°/C°, 3. turn the light on/off, 4. change potentiometer action: dim/set color, 5. sleep.

    Menu options can be selected using the pink button.

The Program in Menu_Internet permits to synchronize the light on the Arduino with a lamp using the Philips Hue API
